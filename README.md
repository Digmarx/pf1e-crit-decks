# FoundryVTT Critical Hit and Fumble Deck for Pathfinder 1st Edition
A Foundry VTT module for Pathfinder 1's Critical Hit and Fumble Deck

This is accessed through the rollltables found in the 'Critical Rolltables - PF1' Compendium.

Open the appropriate rolltable for the Crit or fail and the appropriate weapon/damage type, and roll!

It will then display that roll in chat, and will link to a Buff with the description of that Crit/Fumble.


For Crits/Fumbles that may have a longer duration, you can drag these Buffs onto any Actor as a reminder that the Crit/Fumble is still in effect.
These buffs are stored in the 'Critical Fumbles - PF1' and 'Critical Hits - PF1' Compendiums.
